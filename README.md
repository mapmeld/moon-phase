# Moon-Phase

### [http://mapmeld.github.com/moon-phase This map] is readable only outdoors, at night, during a full moon!

### It does not use Elvish magic, just JavaScript

## Calculating a full moon

Code from http://tingletech.github.com/moon-phase/ calculates times for sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset for your location.

If you access the map between sunrise and sunset, it will display an error.

If you access the map before moonrise or after moonset, it will display an error.

The same http://tingletech.github.com/moon-phase/ code calculates and displays the phase of the moon (this is explained in greater detail below).
If the moon is not full, it will display an error.

## Calculating when you are outdoors

You must share your location for the map to calculate sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset. These coordinates and their accuracy are then fed into a Node.js server.

The master branch of this repo runs on http://moonphase.herokuapp.com. It receives your coordinates and their accuracy, and uses the [http://mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-static-api/ MapBox Static API] to
retrieve a small map of that area. It then uses node-canvas / node-canvas-heroku to count green and blue pixels. If there are enough green and blue pixels (from parks, forests, lakes, or oceans) then
the map will display.  Otherwise you will see an error message.

If you are not outside or want to test which areas will work, use a geolocation spoofer such as [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manual-geolocation/mfodligkojepnddfhkbkodbamcagfhlo?hl=en Manual Geolocation] plugin for Chrome.

My Android phone gives an accuracy of one kilometer. I would need to be near a park and perhaps 0.5km inside to guarantee my location was suitably 'outside'.

My laptop gives a location based on WiFi, but that location does not change as I move away from the WiFi. Only a few WiFi routers would allow this map to appear on my laptop.

==================

This HTML page and javascript draw an `svg` picture of the moon that tries to match the current 
actual phase of the moon.  Also uses unicode emoji moons in the `<title>` element.  A new `svg` will
be calculated every day; but there are only 8 emoji moons.

"A little while ago the task of calculating lunar phases came to mind. After investigating the various algorithms out there, I collected together this little bunch, (mainly wrapped inside complete 'show all the phases for a year' programs), and hacked them about a bit to work nicely with Javascript . They are presented here for your edification, delight and ripping off."

This javascript was modified into a function that returns a number between 0 and 1 representing how 
far through the lunar cycle we are.  0 and 1 are both new moons, 0.5 is the full moon.
